# Hobby-Lobby-Final-Project

<h2>This is the project my team and I worked on for my MIS-3033 course.</h2>

<h3>
This website utilizes ASP.net, C#, Razor/HTML, and JavaScript. This is a fullstack development, with a shared database provided by our professor.
</h3>


<p>
The main purpose of this website is to give Hobby Lobby a Store View and Transportation View.
The Store View lists all of the Hobby Lobby stores in the United States, while allowing an employee to create a new pickup request.
  In the pickup request an employee may select a store, pickup number, and enter specific quantities for Carton, Load Locks, and Totes.
  After creation the data is stored in the database.
  There is also a pickup creation function to allow a scheduled date, pickup capacity, and assigned truck number to be updated on the database.
  
The Transportation View can view, edit, create, and delete details for trucks.
  An employee is able to view or edit a specific truck and update or add a capacity value.

  This project offered the challenge of understanding C#, Razor/HTML, and JavaScript. I not only learned the coding languages better, 
  but I learned to understand how to get them to work with eachother to accomplish a functioning website for Hobby Lobby to potentially use.
  I not only learned how to communicate with a team to develop the website, I also learned how to present the website to an actual Hobby Lobby representative.
